# MYMDITOR

## WHAT IS IT?

It is a personal project made with *django*, *javascript* and *sass* that I have been working on for a few weeks.

I made it with the goal of made a **text editor** of markdown files, but that function doesn't works yet and i should work on it in a future

## HOW IT WORKS ?

Ok, i don't know what should i write here, but i'll write some annotations here

+ **static files** ./mymd/static/

    + **js/**

        + Each template calls an index and that happens

            1. In index import each required script

                Example of genericIndex: 
                ```javascript
                // Import all required scrips
                import Switch_mode from "./switch-mode.js";
                import Model from "./model.js";

                document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function () {
                    // Set all requirements for a basic view

                    console.log("Dom content loaded");
                    const switchMode = new Switch_mode();
                    const model = new Model();

                    switchMode.setModel(model);
                });
                ````

            2. Each script exports an class that will contain the required tools to work

                * ### model.js
                    This script export all tools for **create, read, update and delete** elements and data of the **local storage**

                * ### docView.js, indexViews.js
                    Views manage all the **functions of the view**, buttons, events and whatever that will be necessary for the app

                * ### switch-mode.js
                    Switch-mode.js manage if the page will **use dark style or not**

                * ### docEdit.js
                    docEdit.js just creates **event listeners** required for the **edition of an element value**

                * ### logout.js
                    **Just delete all local storage** values when you log out of your user

                * ### urls.js
                    urls.js just export all tools required for **create and interpret an url**

                * ### ajaxModel.js
                    ajaxModel.js is a model to **request post to update user cloud** data

                * ### alerts.js
                    alerts.js will manage all **alerts display**, these alerts will appear instantly, but if a promise is given, the alert will be deleted when the promise will be resolved.

                    Perfect for alert about the status of post, like download or upload

                    If a promise isn't given, the alert will be deleted after a little delay.
                    
                    In both cases, an element should be in a corner, the alert will be deleted when you click it.
